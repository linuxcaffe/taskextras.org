Since taskwarrior.org made the big changeover from [[http://www.redmine.org/|Redmine]] to .. html, basically, a brave decision was made NOT to carry 7 years of baggage (a.k.a. obsolete docs). 

A [[http://taskwarrior.org|fresh start]] was made, the issues migrated to a [[http://bug.tasktools.org|new system]], the docs are undergoing a major re-write, but sadly the discussion-boards were left behind. While they DID contain many ideas, contributions and concerns, to have "ported them over" to the new site would been a curating nightmare, and would have totally polluted the new site with an ungodly pile of last-years ideas. 

As a major contributor to those boards, I'm aware (guilty) of some signal and a lot of noise. Because I use(d) the boards and a discussion-starter and back-burner, I assume other folks did too, and so taskextras.org is an opportunity to provide a (not very) handy service to my fellow taskwarriors, I'll try to keep these archives available online, right here.

Be aware that they are in a raw state, may be incomplete, have unhelpful filenames and unadorned html, but it IS reference, and it may even be possible to have a DNS re-direct, so that the old links (still embedded in many feature-requests) land on the right file (instead of 404)
