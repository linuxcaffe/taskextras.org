=== About Taskwarrior ===
[[http://taskwarrior.org|Taskwarrior]] is an open-source cross platform command-line task management tool. It allows you to capture, annotate, manipulate and present your tasks, then sync them among devices. 

=== About Taskextras.org ===
Taskextras.org is an experimental site, run (badly) by djp. It is intended to be a place to showcase various task extensions, sub-projects and taskwarrior spin-offs.
Taskextras is also an opportunity to sandbox some website code, that might meke it to taskwarrior.org, but that might otherwise clutter up the discussion of core development. 

=== About This Website ===
This site is made of [[https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki|vimwiki]] + [[http://blog.zzbalabala.com/blog/vimwikiblog_en.html|vimwikiblog]] + [[http://nginx.org/|nginx]]. It is intended to be a reusable, taskwarrior-centric personal wiki. Development files will be shared at [[https://github.com/linuxcaffe/taskwarrior.org|Github]]
