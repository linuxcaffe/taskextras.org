## What?

Taskextras is kind of a support-site, or a fan-site that revolves around taskwarrior.org. The idea is that while the good developers at taskwarrior stay focused on core issues and features, taskextras can look at many of the other, peripheral projects, that make up the taskwarrior ecosystem. Taskextras can also be a site for website-development code, related to taskwarrior. 

## Why?

..well ..for fun, mostly, and to help improve the awareness of all the amazing work independent developers have produced. It is also an opportunity to develop an easy-to-deploy personal wiki/blog, that is uniquely suited to taskwarrior users. 

## How?

This site will take the form of a wiki/ blog site. Blog articles written about taskwarrior extras will be tagged, catagorized and collected, along with other handy help and reference. It's not going to be a "world-writable" sort of wiki, but contributions and pull-requests are invited.

The website generation process is roughly as follows:

1) the source files are written using vimwiki on my laptop. Vimwiki brings markdown and links to life within vim, and the entire site is easily navigable, and editable, from the console. 

2) HTML files are generated by vimwiki, needed folders are created and un-needed files are cleaned up, resulting files are dumped in blog/.

3) VimwikiBlog (an extension of vimwiki) enhances the site with templates, nav elements, generates Archive, Catagories, Tags html pages.

4) rsync blog/ to server. NOTE: there is content in blog/ that is not in this git repo, namely the (old) taskwarrior.org board and wiki archives. Those will be made available throught the site, but are too big, stupid and static to include here.
